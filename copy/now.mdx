### Work

Working as a Web Developer for [Karmarama], using a variety of
technologies.

I'm evangelising Gatsby to anyone that will listen on the team and we
have used Gatsby in several projects now, [asi.style] being one of the
first.

### Play

I have spent quite a lot of the Christmas period playing Borderlands
3!

I'm going to need to pick up the gym again this year and clean up my
diet!
